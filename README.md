# Solving-the-Heat-Equation
I use python in order to solve the heat equation

This beautiful equation was actually first written by Joseph Fourier: du/dt = a * d^u/dx^2
I use the central difference method to approximate the derivatives to get an update equation 
To run this code, you will need numpy and matplotlib
